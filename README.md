This code was written by Michael Kroesche for Professor Jafari's lab
under the supervision of Professor Nowka

The purpose of this code is to receive raw accelerometer and gyroscope data from a polar m600 smart watch, filter and extract features from the data, and train a machine learning model using those features.
